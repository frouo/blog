If you are using Gitlab Enterprise Edition ([EE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/)) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) for continuous integration you may have noticed that, by default, Jenkins triggers a build when a Merge Request is approved.

I personally don't find this useful. Indeed, approvals does not affect code so there no need to re-run the CI.

So, let's be green ðŸŒ± and disable this option in Jenkins, it's easy:

1. Go on your Jenkins project home page
2. Click `Configure` on the left
3. Uncheck `Approved Merge Requets (EE-only)`
4. Finally, do not forget to `Apply` / `Save`!
